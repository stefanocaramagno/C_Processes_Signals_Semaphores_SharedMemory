# C (Processes, Signals, Semaphores and Shared Memory)

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **processes, semaphores, and shared memory** implemented in **C programming**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Operating Systems** course during my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.dieei.unict.it/corsi/l-8-inf) at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it).

## üåç Context

This repository integrates concepts of process management, signal handling, and shared memory management in Unix/Linux systems using C programming. <br>
The exercises cover topics such as shared memory allocation, synchronization using semaphores, inter-process communication via shared memory segments, and handling of synchronization issues.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Setting Up Shared Memory**: Learn how to create, attach, and manage shared memory segments.
- **Basic Semaphore Usage**: Implement basic semaphore operations to synchronize access to shared resources.
- **Advanced Synchronization**: Develop complex synchronization mechanisms using semaphores to handle multiple processes.
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Use shared memory for efficient inter-process communication and solve synchronization issues.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Shared Memory Allocation**: Exercises on learning how to create, attach, and manage shared memory segments using shmget, shmat, and related system calls.
- **Basic Semaphore Operations**: Exercises on implementing basic semaphore operations using semget, semop, and semctl to synchronize access to shared resources.
- **Advanced Synchronization Mechanisms**: Exercises on developing and implementing complex synchronization mechanisms using semaphores to manage multiple processes and avoid race conditions.
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Exercises on using shared memory segments to facilitate efficient communication between processes and address synchronization issues.
- **Practical Applications**: Exercises on applying the concepts of shared memory and semaphores to solve real-world synchronization problems in system programming.
